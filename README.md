# TekBot Speeding
An AVR assembly program for the Atmel Atmega32 Microcontroller to control a bidirectional-motored robot with 16 varying speeds

## What I Learned
- AVR assembly programming
  - conditionals
  - jumps/calls
  - arithmetic
  - constants, register names, data
- I/O porting
  - data direction
  - pull-up
  - output value (if applies)
- External & Internal Interrupts
  - Clock interrupts
  - Button interrupts
- Stack pointer initialization & importance

## How To Use
The program requires the correct hardware device, as well as some software in order to program the hardware.

If the hardware is accessible, the program can be written to the device using Microchip Studio software in combination with an LCD driver extension
